-- Define a CTE for an IT organization (select managers using a CTE): 


-- 1. pull data of all people that are managers
WITH JOBS (id, Name, JobTitle) AS  
(
SELECT 
  ID, 
  Name, 
  Position
FROM employee
WHERE Position like '%Manager%'
),

--2. pull data of all people whose salary > $10,000
SALARIES(id, salary) AS 
(
SELECT 
  ID, 
  Salary
FROM ITSalary
WHERE Salary > 10000
)

SELECT 
JOBS.Name, JOBS.Position, SALARIES.Salary
FROM JOBS
INNER JOIN SALARIES
ON JOBS.ID = SALARIES.ID;


--Exercise 1: 
-- Create a CTE called ITjobs where we want to find any positions that start with IT and their name starts with an A 
-- and whose salary is >$3000

WITH ITjobs (Id, Name, Position) AS (
SELECT 
ID, 
Name, 
Position
FROM employee
WHERE Position LIKE 'IT%' and Name LIKE 'A%'
), 

ITsalary (Id, Salary) AS (
SELECT 
ID, 
Salary
FROM Salary
WHERE Salary > 3000)

Select
ITjobs.Name, 
ITjobs.Position, 
ITsalary.Salary
FROM ITjobs
INNER JOIN Salary
ON ITjobs.Id = Salary.Id;

-- Recursion: 
-- Advantages: 
  -- solve problems that involve recursion (i.e. finding the past 5 generations of parents in your lineage)
  -- recursion should be limited by a termination condition

-- Disadvantages: 
  -- slow execution time

--Example: Finding the sum of consecutive numbers using CTEs

With calculate_SumOfNumber AS (
SELECT 
  1 as iteration, 
  1 as SumofNumber
  UNION ALL

-- Recursive Part
Select iteration + 1, SUMofNumber + (iteration + 1)
FROM calculate_SumofNumber
WHERE iteration < 6
)

Select SumofNumber
FROM calculate_SumofNumber;
)

-- Use DECLARE @local_variabe to define variables in a SQL server

-- Exercise 2: Calculate a factorial of 5: Iteratively

DECLARE @target float = 5 -- define the factorial number
DECLARE @factorial float = 1 -- initial this variable to a specific value

WHILE @target > 0: 
BEGIN
  SET @factorial = @factorial * @target
  SET @target = @target - 1
END

SELECT @factorial;
 -- 1. here we start with factorial = 1 and target = 5 -> 1*5 = 5
 -- 2. then factorial = 5 and target = 4 -> 5*4 = 20
 -- 3. factorial = 20 and target = 3 -> (20) * 3 = (5*4) * 3 = 60
